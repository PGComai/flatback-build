# How to play this demo:

The game will open with an empty flatback. To orbit the camera, hold the middle-mouse-button and move the mouse. Right-click to enter the menu, double-click on "leg", and then place legs by clicking on the edges of the flatback. The stepping order of the legs is the order in which they were placed. Press B when done placing legs. Right-click on nearby terrain to move the flatback.
